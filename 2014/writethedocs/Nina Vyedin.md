Hacking the English language

Applying programming practices to the art of writing

- Don't start with a blank page - make a template
- Ask the right questions - make a spec
    + what question am I trying to answer?
    + who are the target audience?
    + what is the current state of documentation on this topic?
    + what is the work plan?
- Start with an architecture
    + tell a story - follow a linear timeline
    + paint a picture - describe everything on the screen
    + reference - introduce things one at a time and describe
    + theme + situations - idea and use cases
    + drill down - organized by heirarchy, general to specific
    + level up - start simple and reveal info as you go along (getting started guide)
- Name your variables, examples:
    + undefined "it"
    + no ownership - passive voice makes processes or events seem magical
    + vague terms - using generic technical terms
    + unnamed idea - referring to something vaguely or changing the name constantly
- Don't just edit - refactor
    + more than just grammar, typos, etc
