Lack of internal docs causes growing pains

1. write anything - even if it's inaccurate, it's better than nothing (and is likely to be fixed anyways)
2. find other people who are confused as well
3. spread out the work: content, format, critique
  - "take the burden of writing nice things off of the engineers"
