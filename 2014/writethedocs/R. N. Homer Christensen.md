observe - design - evolve

observe
- without preconditioned ideas
- with an open mind
- note whatever draws your attention
- note anything that's missing

design
- consider zones of access
    + where can you gain access to info
    + what does the reader need to know
- determine what info your reader needs most frequently and urgently and make it easy to find

evolve
- know that your system will evolve - and let it happen
- continue to observe and refine
