### Workflow
* ~~Native dev: Code, compile, repeat~~
* Web: live reload!
* Grunt -> Gradle
* DevTools - chrome://inspect/#devices

### Native Features
* `addJavascriptInterface()` (`@JavascriptInterface`)
  * example: show notification

### Design
* Native Components - Built-in design components, eg:
  * Action bar and tabs
  * Navigation drawer
* Demo: button states = :(

### Future
* old WebView is still important :(
* eventually try to auto-update, but for now updates are still tied to android
* chrome apps!
