# Multi-Device Accessibility

Alice Boxhall

> accessibility implies multi-device

### Considerations
* low vision
* hearing impaired / deaf
* low motor ability
* screen reader user
* voice control user

### Do:
* large click targets

### Tools:
* ChromeVox screen reader
* TalkBack on Android
* BrailleBack on chrome
* VoiceOver on iOS/Mac
* **Accessibility developer tools**
  * Audits -> accessibility

### Improving accessiility
* design with diverse users in mind
* manage focus and **make focus visible**
* ensure you have a good keyboard-only UX
* express the semantics of your UI
  * sue standard components
    * `<button>` vs `<div>` etc for click
  * use well written custom components
    * use aria attributes
