JS in 2013

What the language *is*, not how the language is *expressed*

JS is terrible
	syntax
	types
	`this`
	browsers

JS is alright
	simple OO
		constructors
		prototypes
	first-class functions and closures

Tension
	beteen functional and OO programming

ECMAScript, TC39 standards body
	ES262
	ECMAScript 5, 6, 7
	ES4 - failed, DOA
	ES6 -"harmony" as both a name and goal

Nothing is free
	new syntax, new concepts
	new features are powerful in isolation, but complicated in combination
	stuff borrowed from other languages
		generators from python
		weakmaps from c#/java
		promises from E/Haskell?
		should spend more time talking about the needs of JS devs rather than other languages

Integration
	what new things are possible
	what is going to be frustrating

Keep talking about these things so we will be happy with what we have in the future
