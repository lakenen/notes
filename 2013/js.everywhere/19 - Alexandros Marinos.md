JS on Embedded Devices

JS in ... recycle bins?

Perf arms race
	up to 50x on same hardware over last 7y
Embedded devices = server + client
	direct access to hardware
	but also user interaction
JS excels at both server and client
	Node.js
	HTML/CSS
So many devices
	in 2020 -> 50 Billion devices
JS on hardware
	Espruino
	Tessel
	NodeCopter
resin.io
	code deployment
	monitoring
	vpn
	etc
