Making WebRTC Awesome

What is WebRTC, really?
* new RTCPeerConnection - *peer*
* peer <-> peer

> "low-latency peer-to-peer networking in the browser"

Federated communication
* xmpp: federated
* telecom: federated
* facebook, google, msft, apple have solutions, none of which are federated
* web-based federated alternative
* webrtc + xmpp + jingle = otalk (otalk.im)
* stanza.io, jingle.js

> "in less than 5 years webrtc will be the #1 way people make voice calls"
