## Puzzlers!
*very simple programming puzzle that demos or exploits weird behaviors and quirky edge cases in a language*

**That's odd!**
* % keeps sign of left operand

**The one**
* var is hoisted, because JS is not block-level scoped

**Loopty loop!**
* 2^53 is the largest integral value representable by Number in JS
* numbers are represented using the IEEE 754 floating point spec

**Why are we bankrupt?**
* floating point arithmetic can be innacurate when representing fractions

**The prestige**
* order of operations (+ takes precidence over ?)
